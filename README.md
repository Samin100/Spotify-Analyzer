# Introduction
Spotify Analyzer is a tool that will allow you to login with your Spotify credentials and lets you view statistics regarding your music library. These values will then be processed through an artist recommendation system which will then inform you of artists you should enjoy. Currently Spotify Analyzer is in its preliminary planning stage. If you have any recommendations, feel free to 
let me know.
