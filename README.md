# Introduction
Spotify Analyzer is a tool that will allow you to login with your Spotify credentials and lets you view statistics regarding your music library. These values will then be processed through an artist recommendation system which will then inform you of artists you should enjoy. Currently Spotify Analyzer is in its preliminary planning stage. If you have any recommendations, feel free to 
let me know.

This is an short script that tells the user who their most popular artist is for a given playlist CSV file. I've sanitized and included my Year in Review 2016 playlist as a start. In the future, users will be able to select from a list of their existing playlists.
